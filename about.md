title: About me
---

In case you were wondering, I'm a full-stack software developer specializing in Microsoft languages and platforms such as .NET, C# and Azure. I also enjoy writing articles for this website, [kiltandcode.com](https://kiltandcode.com)

I [immigrated to Canada](https://kiltandcode.com/2019/06/30/coming-to-canada-immigrating-to-toronto-as-a-dotnet-developer/) in January 2017 and live in Stratford, Ontario. I'm originally from Scotland, the home of [kilts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilt), the [Loch Ness Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster) and the [deep-fried Mars bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-fried_Mars_bar) *(yes, it's a real thing!)*.
