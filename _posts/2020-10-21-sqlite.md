## Installing SQLite on Windows 10

download and copy files to C:\sqlite
Download SQLite at https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
(screenshot)

## Add PATH Environment Variable for SQLLite

check what the benefit of this is (can we just use "sqllite" in the console?)

## Creating a New SQLite Database

```terminal
.open albums.sqlite
```

creates DB in the C:\sqllite directory

## Executing SQLite Commands in the Command Prompt

.databases to list all of the tables
.tables to list all of the tables
.read to execute a SQL file (saves typing in a lot of SQL into the terminal)
".mode column" to set the output to display left-aligned columns in the terminal
".headers on" to turn the headers on or off in the terminal

link to the full list of SQLite commands in official documentation

## Executing SQL Commands Using SQLite

show how to use ".read create-table.sql" to create an entire table in the current database

quick note (in italic): use transactions to boost performance (BEGIN/COMMIT)
- show SQL script here to create tables and insert some data

```sql
BEGIN;
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS artist (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        title TEXT NOT NULL
    );

    INSERT INTO artist (title) VALUES ('Arcade Fire');
    INSERT INTO artist (title) VALUES ('The Chicks');
    INSERT INTO artist (title) VALUES ('Oasis');
    INSERT INTO artist (title) VALUES ('U2');

    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS album (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
        artist INTEGER,
        title TEXT NOT NULL,
        year INTEGER NOT NULL,
        label TEXT NOT NULL,
        FOREIGN KEY (artist) REFERENCES artist (id)
    );

    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (1, 'Funeral', 2004, 'Rough Trade Records');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (1, 'The Suburbs', 2010, 'Merge Records');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (2, 'Taking the Long Way', 2006, 'Sony Music Nashville');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (3, '(What''s the Story) Morning Glory?', 1995, 'Creation Records');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (3, 'Definitely Maybe', 1994, 'Creation Records');
    INSERT INTO album (artist, title, year, label) VALUES (4, 'The Joshua Tree', 1987, 'Island Records');
COMMIT;
```

run ".tables" to actually check if the table was created in the database

then show how to do "SELECT * FROM table INNER JOIN ..... WHERE ...." to return the row

```sql
SELECT
    artist.title AS [artist], 
    album.title AS [album],
    album.year AS [released],
    album.label AS [record label]
FROM
    album
INNER JOIN artist ON artist.id = album.artist
ORDER BY album.year DESC;
```

## GUI Tools
