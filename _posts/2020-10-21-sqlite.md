## Installing SQLite on Windows 10

download and copy files to C:\sqlite
Download SQLite at https://www.sqlite.org/download.html
(screenshot)

## Add PATH Environment Variable for SQLLite

check what the benefit of this is (can we just use "sqllite" in the console?)

## Creating a New SQLite Database

```terminal
.open test.sqlite
```

creates DB in the C:\sqllite directory

## Executing SQLite Commands in the Command Prompt

.databases to list all of the tables
.tables to list all of the tables
.read to execute a SQL file (saves typing in a lot of SQL into the terminal)
".mode column" to set the output to display left-aligned columns in the terminal
".headers on" to turn the headers on or off in the terminal

link to the full list of SQLite commands in official documentation

## Executing SQL Commands Using SQLite

show how to use ".read create-table.sql" to create an entire table in the current database

quick note (in italic): use transactions to boost performance (BEGIN/COMMIT)
- show SQL script here to create tables and insert some data

run ".tables" to actually check if the table was created in the database

then show how to do "SELECT * FROM table INNER JOIN ..... WHERE ...." to return the row

## GUI Tools
--- unsure if this should be included (useful?)
